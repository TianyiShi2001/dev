The `From` and `Into` traits are good examples of polymorphism.

If a trait uses a generic type `T` in its signature, such as in `From`:

```{rust, eval=FALSE}
pub trait From<T>: Sized {
    fn from(_: T) -> Self;
}
```

then different 'variants' of the trait, where `<T>` is replaced with concrete types, can be implemented. Here is an example: 

```{rust}
struct Foo(i32);
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Bar(i32);

impl From<i32> for Bar {
    fn from(n: i32) -> Self {
        Bar(n)
    }
}

impl<'a> From<&'a Foo> for Bar {
    fn from(foo: &Foo) -> Self {
        Bar(foo.0)
    }
}

fn new_bar<T>(x: T) -> Bar
where
    T: Into<Bar>,
{
    x.into()
}

fn main() {
    let bar1 = Bar::from(1);
    println!("{:?}", bar1);
    let bar2 = Bar::from(&Foo(2));
    println!("{:?}", bar2);
    let bar3 = new_bar(3);
    println!("{:?}", bar3);
    let bar4 = new_bar(&Foo(4));
    println!("{:?}", bar4)
}
```

Here the `From` trait is implemented as `From<i32>` and `From<&'a Foo>` for `Bar`. After their implementation, `Bar::from()` can use either type as its argument. Under the hood, the type of the generic argument is inferred and used to decide whether to call `Bar::from<i32>()` or `Bar::from<&'a Foo>()`. These two types (`i32` and `&'a Foo`) also get `Into<Bar>` implementations for free, which makes `new_bar()` work.
