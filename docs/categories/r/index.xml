      <description>Many R users use R Markdown to author documents, often containing R code, that can be seamlessly rendered into various output formats (usually PDF and HTML) with a single click or keyboard shortcut.

      <description>This post is to remind myself of some not-so-common, but very useful operations in R.
.Rprofile and .Renviron Options  Setting PATH in .Renviron RStudio has a different PATH from bash’s, which can lead command not found when calling system() or system2(). You can set the PATH for RStudio in .Renviron file like this:
PATH=/additional/path:${PATH} Note that curly braces are required.
  Package Management Installing Local Packages: First, open the R Project of the package in RStudio.</description>
